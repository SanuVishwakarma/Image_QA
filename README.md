**Developed a Visual Question Answering (VQA) Application:** Created a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to upload images and ask questions related to the content of the images. The application leverages a fine-tuned Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) model to provide accurate answers, enhancing user interaction with visual data.

**Implemented Image Processing and Machine Learning Integration:** Utilized the PIL library for image handling and the Hugging Face transformers library to deploy a pre-trained VQA model. Ensured efficient processing of image inputs and text queries, resulting in real-time response generation for users.
